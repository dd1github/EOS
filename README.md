# EOS
This repository contains the source code for the paper, "Efficient Augmentation for Imbalanced Deep Learning."
We provide source code, trained models and data to illustrate the application of EOS to the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Training a model with EOS consists of several steps:
1. Train a combined CNN on imbalanced data with cifar_train.py
